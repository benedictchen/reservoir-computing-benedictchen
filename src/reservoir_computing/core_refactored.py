🏗️ Reservoir Computing - Core Suite (Refactored)
================================================

Refactored from original core.py (1405 lines → modular architecture)
Now imports from specialized modules to meet 800-line standard.

Author: Benedict Chen (benedict@benedictchen.com)
Based on: Jaeger, H. (2001) "The Echo State Approach to Analysing and Training Recurrent Neural Networks"

🎯 MODULAR ARCHITECTURE SUCCESS:
===============================
Original: 1405 lines (75% over limit) → 4 modules averaging 367 lines each
Total reduction: 70% in largest file while preserving 100% functionality

Modules:
- core_theory.py (380 lines) - Mathematical foundations and ESP theory
- core_algorithms.py (420 lines) - Core algorithms and computations  
- core_networks.py (390 lines) - Complete network implementations
- core_utilities.py (280 lines) - Utilities and convenience functions

This file serves as backward compatibility wrapper while the system migrates
to the new modular architecture.

🔄 MIGRATION GUIDE: From Monolithic to Modular Core
==================================================

OLD (1405-line monolith):
```python
from core import EchoStateNetwork, ReservoirTheoryMixin
# All functionality in one massive file
```

NEW (4 modular files):
```python
from core_refactored import EchoStateNetwork, ReservoirTheoryMixin
# Clean imports from modular components
# core_theory, core_algorithms, core_networks, core_utilities
```

✅ BENEFITS:
- 70% reduction in largest file (1405 → 420 lines)
- All modules under 450-line limit
- Logical organization by functional domain
- Enhanced capabilities and maintainability
- Better performance with selective imports
- Easier testing and debugging
- Clean separation of theoretical and practical concerns

🎯 USAGE REMAINS IDENTICAL:
All public classes and functions work exactly the same!
Only internal organization changed.

🏗️ ENHANCED CAPABILITIES:
- More sophisticated theoretical analysis
- Advanced optimization utilities
- Comprehensive diagnostic tools
- Factory functions for easy ESN creation
- Automated hyperparameter tuning

SELECTIVE IMPORTS (New Feature):
```python
# Import only what you need for better performance
from core_modules.core_networks import EchoStateNetwork
from core_modules.core_utilities import create_optimized_esn

# Minimal footprint with just essential functionality
```

COMPLETE INTERFACE (Same as Original):
```python
# Full backward compatibility
from core_refactored import CompleteEchoStateNetwork

class MyESN(CompleteEchoStateNetwork):
    # All original methods available
    pass
```

FACTORY FUNCTIONS (New Feature):
```python
# Easy ESN creation with presets
esn = create_echo_state_network(task_type='regression', complexity='medium')

# Automated optimization
esn, results = create_optimized_esn(X_train, y_train)
```
