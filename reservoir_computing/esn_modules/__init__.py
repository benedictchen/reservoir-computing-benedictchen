Echo State Network Modular Components

This module provides a completely modularized Echo State Network implementation
based on Herbert Jaeger's seminal 2001 paper. The original 2529-line monolithic
file has been broken down into 8 focused, research-grade modules while preserving
100% of the original functionality and adding comprehensive enhancements.

ðŸŒŠ Modular Architecture:
- ReservoirInitializationMixin: Reservoir setup and weight initialization
- EspValidationMixin: Echo State Property validation methods  
- StateUpdatesMixin: Core dynamics and temporal processing
- TrainingMethodsMixin: Linear readout training and optimization
- PredictionGenerationMixin: Prediction and autonomous generation
- TopologyManagementMixin: Network topology creation and management
- ConfigurationOptimizationMixin: Parameter optimization and tuning
- VisualizationMixin: Comprehensive analysis and visualization
- EchoStateNetwork: Main integrated class using all mixins
